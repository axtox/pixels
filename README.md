# Pixels
Factorio mod (previously named as Lamps On Map) that shows Pixels on the map with enabled circuit colors, tracking any changes in real-time. Mod adds new entity to the game called Pixel and a set of different color Tiles. When placed, Pixel will also place colored Tile under itself to be able to show the color on the map directly. Updates happening every 3-4th tick, but be careful and don't spam a lot of Pixels - maximum value depends on your PC hardware.


**WARNING**: There's no iterational checkup implemented yet, meaning that all pixels are being processed at a time. So it is not recommended to create more than 15000 Pixels for now.
